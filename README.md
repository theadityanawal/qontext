# qontext - dynamic resume generator

### **What is this project about?**

This is a web application where users can create a **dynamic, AI-powered resume**. The site generates tailored resume content (job descriptions, project highlights, skills, etc.) that aligns with the job the user is applying for. The system analyzes the job description and crafts a personalized resume on the fly.

### **How does it work?**

Let’s simplify this into **key parts** and **explainable steps**:

1. **User Dashboard**:
   - The user logs into the app.
   - They input their **personal details** (e.g., name, email) and build a boilerplate resume (basic information like work experience, skills, and projects).
   - They upload a job description or provide a job link.
2. **AI-Powered Personalization**:
   - The app reads the job description to understand what the employer is looking for.
   - It compares this job requirement with the user’s boilerplate resume.
   - AI dynamically rewrites certain sections of the resume, highlighting specific experiences and skills that match the job.
3. **Output**:
   - The user gets a beautifully generated resume tailored to the job description.
   - They can download it as a PDF or share it directly.

### **What are the critical parts?**

#### **Frontend (What user sees)**

- **Framework**: Next.js
   - Displays the resume builder and user dashboard.
   - Dynamically updates the resume preview.
- **Key Pages**
   - Login/Sign-up
   - Resume Editor (for boilerplate input)
   - AI Tailor Page (input job description and get tailored output)

#### **Backend (How things run behind the scenes)**

- **Appwrite**
   - **Authentication**: Handles user sign-up/login.
   - **Database**: Stores user information (like their resume details).
   - **Functions**: Executes the AI tailoring process.
   - **Storage**: Saves uploaded job descriptions and generated resumes.


#### **AI Engine**

- **GPT Models**
   - Reads the job description and analyzes key requirements (e.g., "Must know React").
   - Pulls user data (e.g., "React experience") and rewrites sections dynamically.

#### **Hosting & Deployment**

- **Vercel**
   - Hosts your frontend Next.js app.
   - Handles serverless function calls to Appwrite for AI tailoring and data storage.

#### **Version Control**

- **GitHub**:
   - Keeps track of your code changes and acts as a backup.

### **How do these pieces connect?**

1. **Frontend**
   - The user interacts with the **Next.js** app.
   - It sends their inputs (e.g., personal details or job descriptions) to the backend.
2. **Backend**
   - **Appwrite** processes user inputs
      - Saves user data in the database.
      - Sends the job description and resume to the **AI engine**
   - Once AI generates tailored content, Appwrite sends the updated resume back to the frontend.
3. **Hosting**
   - The app is deployed on **Vercel**, where users can access it online.

> ### **Simplifying further**

> Imagine you’re writing a letter for every job you apply to, but instead of doing it yourself, you:

1. > Write down your general bio and work history once.
2. > Tell an assistant (AI) what job you’re applying for.
3. > The assistant reads the job description, looks at your bio, and writes a letter (resume) specifically tailored for that job.

> #### **qontext** is that assistant.

### **Key MVP Features**

Here’s how we simplify it further, focusing only on what’s absolutely necessary

1. **User Sign-Up/Log-In** (Appwrite Auth)
2. **Resume Builder**:
   - User inputs basic details (name, work history, etc.)
3. **Job Upload**:
   - User pastes a job description or uploads a file
4. **AI Personalization**:
   - The app generates a tailored resume
5. **Download Option**:
   - The user downloads the finished PDF resume

## **Challenges and Considerations**

1. ### Rate Limiting and Costs
   - Implement caching to reduce API calls
   - Store generated content for similar job types
   - Use clustering to group similar jobs and reuse content
2. ### Content Quality
   - Implement content validation rules
   - Create fallback mechanisms if generation fails
   - Add human review option for important applications
3. ### Performance
   - Use edge caching for faster delivery
   - Implement progressive enhancement
   - Pre-generate content for common job types
4. ### Privacy and Security
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add authentication for admin features
   - Secure storage of original content
